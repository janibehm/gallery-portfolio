The stack I used on this app is the following: React, NextJs, TailwindCss, PostgreSQL and SupaBase for storage purposes.
 
In the front-end I used React and NextJs. The project is deployed on Vercel.
In the "image-gallery" section the images are fetched from Supabase with PostgresSQL.
(I will write more in-depth analysis about this project in near future)
I hope this project may help you understand technologies used in this app.
If there's something you're curious about this project you can contact me and I will try to reply as soon as possible.



This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
